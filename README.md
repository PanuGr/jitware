Entry for redesign of jitware.be

I have completely rebuilt the page using your instructions. Here is a summary of the changes:

## Technologies
I used *Tailwindcss* along with *DaisyUI* to quickly create clean and modern elements. This gives the page a cohesive and professional look.

## Design & Layout
The page is now fully responsive and uses a cleaner, modern aesthetic with plenty of white space, improving readability.
### Hero Section
The top of the page has been completely redesigned with a dynamic headline, clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs), and a more professional look to immediately grab attention.

### Animations
I have added subtle animations that activate on scroll to make the experience more engaging.
Statistic numbers (e.g., "+75% More Visitors") come to life as they appear on the screen.

### Sections
All sections have been redesigned to be more visually appealing, using cards, icons, and a consistent style.

### Accessibility & Performance
I've taken into account best practices, such as lazy loading images for better performance and adding a "Skip to main content" link for improved accessibility.

You can easily modify the code and use it as your new index.html file.
